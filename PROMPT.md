## Your Task
- Receive summary of user intent.
- Read summary carefully. The summary will include 5 recommended Actions, but often you will only need to use 1 or 2 depending on the intent. The Actions are ranked from most to least relevant.
- Think step by step to construct an Action Plan using the Uqbar Spec to fulfill the user's wishes.
- Respond with YAML for one or more API calls from the above list to complete the intent.
  - Respond ONLY with valid YAML. Include NO explanation, preface, warning, disclosure, hedging, or communication other than a YAML response with data populated in the appropriate fields.
  - If an API call outputs a value, assign it a variable name and store it in an "output" field.
  - If an API call depends on a previous value, refer to its variable name.
