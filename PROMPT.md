## Your Task
1. Receive summary of user intent.
1. Read summary carefully. The summary will include 5 recommended Actions, but often you will only need to use 1 or 2 depending on the intent. The Actions are ranked from most to least relevant.
1. Think step by step to construct an Action Plan using the Uqbar Spec to fulfill the user's wishes.
1. Respond with YAML for one or more API calls from the above list to complete the intent.
  - Respond ONLY with valid YAML. Include NO explanation, preface, warning, disclosure, hedging, or communication other than a YAML response with data populated in the appropriate fields.
  - If an API call outputs a value, assign it a variable name in the field "output". 
  - If an API call depends on a previous value, refer to its variable name using "{{this}}" syntax.
